### BoxWorld 2

[Game](http://hirudov.com/others/BoxWorld2.php)


**BoxWorld 2** is a solitary type game where the player needs to move on the board with the the **ARROW** keys to reach the exit, in order to advance to the next level. The game has several obstacles that the player needs to overcome to finish the level. There are boxes that can be pushed and holes that can be filled with boxes in order to move over them. The player starts with a specific number of lives, and if he or she gets stuck, can press the **R** key to reload the same level with the expense of one life. The progress of the game can be saved pressing the **S** key at any given time and can be loaded later by pressing the **L** key.

For this assignment we need to create a program that is able to solve different levels of the game using the following research methods:

1. Search in Width
2. Search in Depth
3. Prograssive Deepening
4. Uniform Cost
5. Greedy Search
6. A*

Then we need to compare the different research methods based on the quality of the obtained solution, the total number of operations occured and the time taken to obtain the solution. Furthermore the program must have some kind of visualization whether text-based or graphical so the user can see the evolution of the board. Finally the program must be able to solve the game by its own using the method and the board configuration provided by the user. Optionally a game mode that the user plays and asks the program for "tips" can be implemented.
