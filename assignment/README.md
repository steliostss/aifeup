    *BoxWorld 2* is a solitary type game where the player needs to move on the board with the the *ARROW* keys to reach the exit, in order to advance to the next level. The game has several obstacles that the player needs to overcome to finish the level. There are boxes that can be pushed and holes that can be filled with boxes in order to move over them. The player starts with a specific number of lives, and if he or she gets stuck, can press the *R* key to reload the same level with the expense of one life. The progress of the game can be saved pressing the *S* key at any given time and can be loaded later by pressing the *L* key.
